> Collaborative Live-Coding Virtual Worlds with an Immersive Instrument

*Alive* is an instrument allowing multiple users to develop sonic and visual behaviors of agents in a virtual world, through a browser-based collaborative code interface, accessible while being immersed through spatialized audio and stereoscopic display. 

The interface adds terse syntax for query-based pre- cise or stochastic selections and declarative agent manipulations, lazily-evaluated expressions for synthesis and behavior, event handling, and flexible scheduling. We use data-oriented concepts of entities (*agents*), associations (*tags*), selections (*queries*) and behaviors (*expressions*) in code fragments that may be manually triggered or scheduled for future execution using coroutines.

The project is informed by our work as researchers in [the AlloSphere](http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/), a three-story, immersive, spherical virtual reality environment at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Although one specific venue inspired Aliveâ€™s development, we belive it may be easily applied to other facilities.
