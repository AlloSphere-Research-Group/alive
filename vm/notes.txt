VM
--

Launched by the proxy.js node as a child process
	(so that crashes can be accepted, and stdio can be routed)

VM should stay active most of the time though (hopefully avoiding crashes)

VM runs apps from a 'main' file (lua or cpp)
VM features:
	- clang run-time compiler
	- filewatcher, to reload resources (& recompile cpps/glsls etc.)
	- audio driver
	- gl windows
	- etc.

One way to do this is LuaAV style set of modules/libraries
	mostly implemented in a VM's own script


Tube
----

A fast way to send messages to audio thread (and back)
Typically strings, numbers, pointers, POD structs etc.

All messages are timestamped


LuaAV sent:
	play (ctx, voice)
	stop (voice)
	parameter set (voice, paramidx, value<T>?, offset?, chans?)
	addsignal (ctx, ptr)
received:
	typeddelete (obj)
